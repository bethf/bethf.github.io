          <h5>June 29, 2014</h4>
          <img class="pure-img" src="img/rsz_1blogger.jpg"/>
            <p>There are tons of blogs around about children's books, but so far most of them have been written by adults. But now junior bookworms are having their say as children start to blog about the books they love reading.</p>
<p>We think it's really cool when children blog about the books they read. Blogs like this are a great way to tell the world about a book you';ve enjoyed, or to get ideas for books you might like to read, or just to find other bookworms like you.</p>
<p>And if you're an adult wanting to find ideas for books for your child to read, book blogs written by children are a great place to look. Not so much from the horse's mouth as from the bookworm's eyes.</p>
<p>Here are some of our favourite book review blogs written by children and teens:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.freehtml5templates.co.uk"><strong>What Should I Read Next?</strong></a> is a fascinating book review blog for tweens and teens written by 14-year-old bookworm Maya from Wales.</li>
<li><a title="What Ruby Read Next" href="http://rubyreadsbooks.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>What Ruby Read Next</strong></a> &#8211; Thirteen year old Ruby addresses the difficult question of what to read when you're too old for children's books but too young for adult literature.</li>
<li><a title="Flea Reads" href="http://fleareads.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Flea Reads</strong></a><strong> &#8211; </strong>This one is unique because it&#8217;s the only video blog on our list. Seven year old bookworm Flea reports on the books she loves and hopes you will too.</li>
<li><a title="Just Being Me blog" href="http://alison.tk/" target="_blank"><strong>Just Being Me</strong> </a>- A 12 year old mixing up book reviews with a charity challenge to raise money via playing guitar. Go Alys!</li>
<li><a title="Childtastic Books" href="http://childtasticbooks.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Childtastic Books</strong></a> &#8211; A co-written blog from nine year old Holly and her mum Sam. As well as book reviews, they chew the fat about reading-related issues.</li>
<li><a title="The turtle of happiness" href="http://www.turtleofhappiness.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Turtle of Happiness</strong></a><strong> &#8211; </strong>Nine year old Mr Turtle is planning to review every book he reads, and has even had a visit from the author of one of his favourite Doctor Who books.</li>
<li><a title="SpiderSpider" href="http://spider.thetomorrowclub.com/" target="_blank"><strong>SpiderSpider</strong> </a>- This talented nine year old boy has a great eye for a funny book, as he reports on reading and other adventures.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Bookhi" href="http://bookhi.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bookhi </a></strong>- An inspiring and comprehensive book blog from 14 year old reader Zoe</li>
<li><strong><a title="The Teen Book Guru" href="http://www.teenbookguru.com/" target="_blank">The Teen Book Guru</a> </strong>- Incredibly popular Young Adult book review site from 15 year old Riya</li>
<li><a title="Mini Bookworms" href="http://minibookworms.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mini Bookworms</strong></a> &#8211; A collective of parent bloggers and their children who love to read.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you know of any more child book bloggers (or you write one), leave the address in the comments box below and we will include you in a future roundup.</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
<p>Remember, reading is cool! And blogging about reading is a double volume of cool!</p>
