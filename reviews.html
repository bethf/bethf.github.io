            <p>These book reviews have been written by kids like you. If you would like to submit a review of a book, send it to <a id="email" href="#">reviews@diaryofareadingkid.com</a>. Please do not give away any secrets in the book or tell how it ends! We all want to experience the excitement of discovering what lies within a book's cover. If you would also like to include a rating at the end, please use a scale of 1-5 where 1 means you did not like the book and 5 means you loved it. For example if you mostly did not like a book, but there were good parts, you might give it a 2/5. Let us know what you think - good or bad!</p>
